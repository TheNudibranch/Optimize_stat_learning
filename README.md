### Statistical Learning

Statistical learning has taken off in the recent years, and people are quite happy to just import them, apply them to some data, and call it a day. Not me, I want to apply the statistical learning methods from scratch and build them from the ground up. This repository is a bunch of ipy notebooks and other accesory files to learn how these statistical learning methods acutally work.
